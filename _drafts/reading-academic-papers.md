Reading research papers and articles oftentimes tends to be quite a daunting task.
The main difficulties for me present themselves in the areas of understanding the argument of a paper. 

- I cannot seem to grasp the process that has lead to presented conclusions
- there are parts seemingly missing from the reasoning that appear as crucial for getting the whole picture
- ...

Apart from that, a pressing issue is that of the effort to reward ratio.
Unless you are well versed in the field in which it is set or are some kind of a prodigy, just a paper (even mindfully) will most likely lead to confusion and leave you with a ton of questions with precisely zero answers. 
Re-reading it *may* help, but unless it is a long or an especially dense one, there is a good chance that you are going to dedicate much more of your time and effort to understand it than it is needed.

Long story short -  *reading scientific papers in a straightforward way is not the most efficient way to get the most of them*.

There is some information on that topic in various parts of the internet, to which I link at the end.
There is a lot of link following involved though, and I thought it would be beneficial to stitch together the not necessarily related materials into a more comprehensive post.

## Start!

An important thing to note is that authors expect the reader to have sufficient background knowledge - the extent of what is deemed sufficient can vary drastically from paper to paper.
To assess whether your level of knowledge in the subject area is adequate, read the title and the abstract and, before going any further, review what do you actually know about it.
If you find yourself missing elements that are treated as given by the authors, find a review or a textbook and gain the required background.
If find out that you have sufficient knowledge, this type of analysis is beneficial as well - you become aware of the ways in which upcoming topics will fit in with your current information.

When approaching a paper, make a preliminary list of subtopics you would expect or like to find in your reading - these will give you "a-ha!" moments and also help labelling your notes.

## Peter Klein's method - the art of skimming

Professor Peter Klein has published this method as a handout to his students in 2010.
I find it extremely helpful in dealing with works that leave me stumped otherwise.
The original publishing can be found [here](http://organizationsandmarkets.com/2010/08/31/how-to-read-an-academic-article/).

The method consists of two stages.
Firstly, the reader needs to focus on "embracing" the paper mentally.
Secondly, to cement the understanding of the matter and argument, an individual critique of it should be developed.

### Step 1: Skimming
1. Read the abstract if provided.
1. Read the introduction.
1. Read the conclusion.
1. Skim the middle
    - look at elements that stand out the most: section titles, tables, figures etc.
    - the idea here is to get a feel for the style and flow of the paper
        - is it methodological, empirical, tehoretical, conceptual or something else?
        - is it a theoretical contribution, an empirical application of a theory, a critique or something else?

1. Read the whole paper quickly.
    - skip the equations, figures, tables, code listings etc.
1. Go back again and carefully read the whole thing, focusing on the most "meaty" parts.

### Step 2: Analysis through critique
1. Ask if the reasoning makes sense.
    - Is it internally consistent?
    - Is it substantiated by arguments or evidence? What is the quality of this evidence?
    - Why are the conclusions important?
    - Mr Klein states here that this skill takes some experience to develop. It's so true that it almost hurts. :) Actually talking yourself through the critique process, writing down questions and answering them verbally is one thing that has helped me to get *somewhat closer* to being able to do it.
1. Compare the article to others you've read on the same or a closely related subject.
    - If this is your first, find some other ones and skim them, focusing on introductions and conclusions.
    - See how the arguments match up between the papers: are they consistent, contradictory or maybe do not really relate?
    - Use [Google Scholar](https://scholar.google.com), a citation index, science publisher web pages etc. as well as discussion groups or blogs to see where is this article quoted and what they say about it.
    - Check out a reference work - something from a well-established journal, handbook or encyclopedia to see how this article fits in the broader context of its subject area.

## Note-taking
*(This part was firstly named "Supplementary techniques", but after reading it again I saw that it's all about taking notes so... ;) )*

From my own experience, note-taking is a crucial part of intelligently reading an academic paper.
This applies mostly to cases when you have a problem with understanding the concepts presented in a paper.
If you don't have any issues with that and just want to focus on optimizing your effort/reward ratio, you may want to skip some of those.

*Maximize the usefulness of your notes.*
Taking notes may seem pretty obvious, but it's important that they should be useful enough to serve as a reliable anchor when you get back to them after some time.
Two aspects of this are of utmost importance:

1. Leave a lot of space in the notes for your comments - questions, second thoughts, cross-references.
1. Make it a priority to express the ideas you encounter within the paper in your own words.
   This is one of the more efficient ways of internalizing the paper's contents. Paraphrasing word by word is a waste of time, you are not exercising your understanding of the topic and thus not getting familiar with it. An example of a good way to do this is to write the most important ideas down as headings and then write a few sentences to explain them as clearly as possible and give examples. _Do not depend on underlining and highlighting._ This is a context-less method of attracting attention, which is not what you are aiming for at this point.


*When encountering terms and statements you don't understand, include them in the notes accompanied by questions that state your doubts.*
The questions can range from simple ones such as "what does xxx mean" to more complex e.g. ... (TODO: remind yourself the questions you asked in Chen, Kanj, Xia).
If you have other thoughts or when you find answers to your questions, write them down there as well - it is beneficial to keep a reading journal that you can consult anytime in the future.

*Within your notes, colour-code the elements of the paper that are not directly understandable (i.e. they warrant explanation in the paper or you have to look them up) but are used as building blocks for the main conclusions.*
This often helps to increase the "at-a-glance" visibility of how the paper arguments are structured.

*To be able to see structure even better, try as far as possible to put notes on separate cards.*
This not only supersedes the idea of colour-coding with its usefulness, but also helps you keep your notes focused.
Having the physical ability to move the cards around and group them enables you to stimulate your intelligence in different ways, visualize the connections and see how the flow of the argument may proceed.

*Take advantage of the [spacing effect](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Spacing_effect).*
Leave the paper and your notes lying around even if you don't understand everything from the get-go. Read the notes again after a few days, following up on the things you forgot during that time. The fresh perspective oftentimes leads to a breakthrough.
I try to maintain a process of making my notes manually in a paper notebook and then persisting them to a computer (`org-mode` or `vimwiki`).
When I finish the notes on an article and start feeling comfortable with what it presents, I give myself a few days to "forget" and then after some time get to writing them down on a computer.
This makes me go over them more honestly and tends to further cement the knowledge that the material bears.

## Some words of consolation

Don't beat yourself up too much if you can't seem to get through a paper and understand it as much as you would want to.
There is a strong chance that it is just poorly written.
Think about it, scientists mostly are not Shakespeares - most of them does not enjoy writing and is happy to finally finish putting their thoughts on paper, because it allows them to continue doing more interesting stuff.

Additionally, think about moments when you tried to explain an involved topic that was absolutely natural to you, to somebody who didn't have a clue about it.
You may have spent significant amounts of time and effort on it or it just happens to be something that fits your brain perfectly due to your knowledge and experience in the subject matter.
Did you have any clarity issues?
Or maybe "too much details" issues?
In the state of mind of having internalized a difficult concept it tends to be very difficult to take a step back and look at it objectively.
Even more so trying to assume the point of view of a less experienced reader.
In academic papers this leads most often to the following issues:

- Leaving out logical connections. These seem of little value to the author, but are often pertinent to the reader, usually bridging the gap between obscurity and understanding.
- Lack of a clear literary backbone. Less important details are often given too much attention - this upstes the balance between vital and ancillary information that the reader should acquire from the paper. The effect is, of course, confusion. The reader is more prone to lose track of the argument while following the digressions.
- Long chain of back-referrals. The core of this issue seems similar to the one stemming from deep submersion in the topic. The foundations (i.e. somebody else's work) on which a paper is based are treated as common knowledge and are explained just by referring to the papers which where used by the authors. Looking them up often breeds further generations of the same problem, but regarding different topics. Sometimes, unfortunately, this is a sad necessity due to space limitations. Usually you will have to get out your shovel and keep on digging.
